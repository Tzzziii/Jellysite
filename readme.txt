This website is a sample homepage for the website "Jellysite", a fun idea of a site pretending to be for Jellyfish activists. In theory, it would sell Jellyfish inspired merchandise, talk about different types
of Jellyfish news and other impactful stuff in the form of a blog-type news website.
There were some formatting issues such as the "read more" button not being where I wanted it to be exactly as well as some issues with the h1 titles not moving to a new line when the sentence became to long, etc.
Those issues are still being worked on to fix the exact formatting but for now, this is what the site is intended to look like with some other future changes/CSS changes.
